# SmartEV-Battery-Lifespan-Predictor-
SmartEV Battery Lifespan Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the remaining useful life of electric vehicle (EV) batteries with high accuracy. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) built on the Keras framework, the model applies advanced regression techniques to analyze and forecast battery performance over time.
